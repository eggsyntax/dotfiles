;; The deps.edn file describes the information needed to build a classpath.
;;
;; When using the `clojure` or `clj` script, there are several deps.edn files
;; that are combined:
;; - install-level
;; - user level (this file)
;; - project level (current directory when invoked)
;;
;; For all attributes other than :paths, these config files are merged left to right.
;; Only the last :paths is kept and others are dropped.

{
  ;; Paths
  ;;   Directories in the current project to include in the classpath

  ;; Aliases
	;;   resolve-deps aliases (-R) affect dependency resolution, options:
	;;     :extra-deps - specifies extra deps to add to :deps
	;;     :override-deps - specifies a coordinate to use instead of that in :deps
	;;     :default-deps - specifies a coordinate to use for a lib if one isn't found
	;;   make-classpath aliases (-C) affect the classpath generation, options:
	;;     :extra-paths - vector of additional paths to add to the classpath
	;;     :classpath-overrides - map of lib to path that overrides the result of resolving deps
